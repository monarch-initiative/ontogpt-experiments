Nutrition Follow-Up

TPN initiated on 11/12 via PICC line, infant reached goal PN prescription on 11/16. All labs WNL. SS placed to
gravity on POD #6 and d/c POD #7. Infant remains intubated. Peds surg cleared infant for feeds 11/18.
Planning to initiate trophic feeds 11/18 with EHM. Anticipate placing infant on SFG1. Will monitor tolerance.

Diagnosis
1. Altered GI function related to s/p pyloromyotomy complicated by duodenal perf as evidenced by NPO,
need for TPN support- Actual, unresolved, improvement shown

Nutrition Interventions
1. Wean PN macronutrients as feeds advance. – Goal: prevent overfeeding
2. Initiate trophic feeds of 10 mls q 3 hrs of EHM 20 kcal/oz. - Goal: GI stimulation.
3. If tolerated, begin SFG 1, line 2 on 4/19, advancement 1 line per day. – Goal: gradual advancement to
goal enteral feeds
4. Recommend CMP, Mg, Phos, M/Th on stable PN. Goal: Electrolytes WNL
5. Recommend daily weights. Goal: monitor fluid status .

Follow Up 1-3 days (11/19-11/21)
