Nutrition Assessment

BB is a 6-month-old female who presented to the ED with complaints of projectile vomiting over the past
couple of days. Emesis is non-bilious. Parents report emesis is large and forceful, occasionally reaching as far
as the other side of the table. Nutrition hx of exclusive BF and recent introduction of solids 2 weeks ago. Pt has
trialed iron fortified cereal, pureed green beans and bananas. CBC and BMP obtained upon admit, noted
hypernatremia most consistent with dehydration. Pyloric US obtained, noted an enlarged pylorus (16mm) and
muscle thickness of 4mm, redundant pyloric mucosa protruding into the gastric antrum and indentation of the
pylorus with no passage of gastric contents. Pt started on D5 +1/4 NS at 1.2x/maintenance and electrolytes
corrected. Peds surg consulted, s/p pyloromyotomy on 11/11. Complications of surgery included duodenal
perforation. Pt remains intubated, PICC line placed 4/11 with SS to LIS. Plan for initiation of TPN support
tonight. RD following with team.

Physical Findings:

Nutritional Hx: Exclusively BF ~7x/day for 15-20 minutes, mom rarely pumps but will get ~4 oz at each pump
session. Introduced solids 2 weeks ago (iron fortified cereal, purees).

Current Diet Order: NPO

Fluids: 750 ml (Holliday Segar)
Calories: 825 (110 kcal/kg)
Protein: 3-3.5 gm/kg

Diagnosis
1. Altered GI function related to s/p pyloromyotomy complicated by duodenal perf as evidenced by NPO,
need for TPN support- Actual, Initial

Nutrition Interventions
1. Recommend initiation of TPN D10%, AA 3 gm/kg at 28 mL/hr x 24 hrs + SMOF 2 gm/kg at 3.1 mL/hr x
24 hrs. – Goal: prevent catabolism through initiation of nutrition support
2. Recommend advancing TPN by no more than D 2.5% daily (equates to GIR increase of 1.8
mg/kg/min/d), to goal TPN prescription of D15%, AA 3/5 gm/kg/d at 28 mL/hr + 4.7 mL/hr x 24 hrs. -
Goal: Meet goal caloric and protein needs.
3. Recommend CMP, Mg, Phos daily. Goal: Electrolytes WNL
4. Recommend daily weights. Goal: monitor fluid status .

Follow Up 1-3 days (11/12-11/15)
