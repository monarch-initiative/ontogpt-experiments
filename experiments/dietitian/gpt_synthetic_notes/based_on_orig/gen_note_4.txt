Nutrition Assessment

SM is a 9-year-old male who presented to the ED with complaints of chronic cough, difficulty breathing, and poor growth. Admitted to the Pulmonology floor for further evaluation and management. Chest X-ray and CT scan confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis with bronchiectasis. Now s/p bronchoscopy and mucus clearance (6/10) with Dr. V. Pt was NPO initially with IV fluids, diet advanced on POD 1. Plan for long-term pulmonary management and nutritional support. RD now consulted due to poor PO intake and significant weight loss over the past three months. Met with family at bedside; parents report that at baseline, SM is a moderate eater, but his appetite has significantly decreased since his symptoms worsened. Reports daily intake of <40% of usual intake. Parents estimate SM has lost approximately 4 kg since a pediatrician visit three months ago (14% weight loss). Per growth chart review, noted pt has lost ~3.8 kg since a PCP appointment 3 months ago (14% weight loss). Pt noted to have a very thin appearance with severe muscle wasting. Parents report that since the diagnosis, SM has been more fatigued and has had decreased activity levels. Discussed nutritional support options, including high-calorie, high-protein supplements. Plan to start ONS TID in-between meals. RD following with Pulmonology Team.
