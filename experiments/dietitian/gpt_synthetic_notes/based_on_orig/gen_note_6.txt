Nutrition Assessment

MK is a 14-year-old male who presented to the ED with complaints of edema, fatigue, and decreased urine output over the past month. Admitted to the Nephrology floor for further evaluation and management. Lab results confirmed diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome with significant proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia. Now s/p renal biopsy (6/10) with Dr. P. Pt was NPO initially with IV fluids, diet advanced on POD 1. Plan for long-term renal management and nutritional support. RD now consulted due to poor PO intake and significant weight loss. Met with family at bedside; parents report that at baseline, MK is a moderate eater, but his appetite has significantly decreased since symptoms worsened. Reports daily intake of <40% of usual intake. Parents estimate MK has lost approximately 5 kg since a pediatrician visit one month ago (12% weight loss). Per growth chart review, noted pt has lost ~4.8 kg since a PCP appointment 1 month ago (12% weight loss). Pt noted to have a thin appearance with mild muscle wasting. Parents report that since diagnosis, MK has been more lethargic and less active. Discussed nutritional support options, including low-sodium, high-protein diet. Plan to start ONS TID in-between meals. RD following with Nephrology Team.

Diagnosis:

Severe protein-calorie malnutrition related to nephrotic syndrome and poor oral intake, as evidenced by BMI z-score deceleration of -1.0, weight loss of 12% body weight x 1 month, poor PO intake meeting <40% goal nutritional needs x 1 month – Actual, Initial
Inadequate protein and energy intake related to poor appetite and recent renal intervention, as evidenced by minimal PO intake post-op, need for nutritional supplementation – Actual, Initial
Nutrition Interventions:

Continue with low-sodium, high-protein diet, encourage 3 meals and 2 snacks/day – Goal: Optimal nutrient intake and support renal function
Recommend starting Nepro with Carb Steady – Vanilla, TID in-between meals – Goal: Supplement PO intake
Recommend obtaining baseline 25-OH Vitamin D level with next lab draw. Goal: Prevent vitamin D deficiency
Recommend daily weights. Goal: Prevent further weight loss, monitor malnutrition
