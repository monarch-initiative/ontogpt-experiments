Nutrition Assessment

LG is a 7-year-old female who presented to the ED with complaints of recurrent seizures, fatigue, and poor appetite over the past two months. Admitted to the Neurology floor for further evaluation and management. EEG and MRI confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy. Now s/p initial anti-epileptic drug therapy (6/11) with Dr. R. Pt was NPO initially with IV fluids, diet advanced on POD 1. Plan for long-term neurological management and nutritional support. RD now consulted due to poor PO intake and significant weight loss. Met with family at bedside; parents report that at baseline, LG is a moderate eater, but her appetite has significantly decreased since symptoms worsened. Reports daily intake of <35% of usual intake. Parents estimate LG has lost approximately 2 kg since a pediatrician visit two months ago (11% weight loss). Per growth chart review, noted pt has lost ~1.8 kg since a PCP appointment 2 months ago (11% weight loss). Pt noted to have a thin appearance with mild muscle wasting. Parents report that since diagnosis, LG has been more lethargic and has had decreased activity levels. Discussed nutritional support options, including a ketogenic diet to support seizure management. Plan to start ONS TID in-between meals. RD following with Neurology Team.

Protein: 1.2-1.5 g/kg
Diagnosis:

Severe protein-calorie malnutrition related to epilepsy and poor oral intake, as evidenced by BMI z-score deceleration of -1.0, weight loss of 11% body weight x 2 months, poor PO intake meeting <35% goal nutritional needs x 2 months – Actual, Initial
Inadequate protein and energy intake related to poor appetite and recent neurological intervention, as evidenced by minimal PO intake post-op, need for nutritional supplementation – Actual, Initial
Nutrition Interventions:

Continue with ketogenic diet, encourage 3 meals and 2 snacks/day – Goal: Optimal nutrient intake and seizure management
Recommend starting KetoCal 4:1 – Vanilla, TID in-between meals – Goal: Supplement PO intake
Recommend obtaining baseline 25-OH Vitamin D level with next lab draw. Goal: Prevent vitamin D deficiency
Recommend daily weights. Goal: Prevent further weight loss, monitor malnutrition
