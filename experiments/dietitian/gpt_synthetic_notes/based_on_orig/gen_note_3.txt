Nutrition Assessment

LD is a 7-year-old female who presented to the ED with complaints of fatigue, shortness of breath, and poor growth. Admitted to the Cardiology floor for further evaluation. Echocardiogram and MRI confirmed diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy. Now s/p cardiac catheterization (6/8) with Dr. W. Pt was NPO initially with IV fluids, diet advanced on POD 2. Plan for long-term cardiac management and potential listing for heart transplant. RD now consulted due to poor PO intake and significant weight loss over the past two months. Met with family at bedside; parents report that at baseline, LD is a good eater, but her appetite has significantly decreased since symptoms worsened. Reports daily intake of <50% of usual intake. Parents estimate LD has lost approximately 2.5 kg since a pediatrician visit two months ago (10% weight loss). Per growth chart review, noted pt has lost ~2.3 kg since a PCP appointment 2 months ago (10% weight loss). Pt noted to have a thin appearance with moderate muscle wasting. Parents report that since the diagnosis, LD has been more lethargic and has had decreased activity levels. Discussed nutritional support options, including high-calorie, high-protein supplements. Plan to start ONS TID in-between meals. RD following with Cardiology Team.
