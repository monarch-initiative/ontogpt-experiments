Nutrition Assessment

ZL is an 8-year-old male who presented to the ED with jaundice, fatigue, and poor appetite over the past month. Admitted to the Hepatology floor for further evaluation and management. Lab results confirmed diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis with elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin. Now s/p liver biopsy (6/10) with Dr. S. Pt was NPO initially with IV fluids, diet advanced on POD 1. Plan for long-term hepatic management and nutritional support. RD now consulted due to poor PO intake and significant weight loss. Met with family at bedside; parents report that at baseline, ZL is a moderate eater, but his appetite has significantly decreased since symptoms worsened. Reports daily intake of <30% of usual intake. Parents estimate ZL has lost approximately 3 kg since a pediatrician visit one month ago (12% weight loss). Per growth chart review, noted pt has lost ~2.8 kg since a PCP appointment 1 month ago (12% weight loss). Pt noted to have a thin appearance with mild muscle wasting. Parents report that since diagnosis, ZL has been more lethargic and has had decreased activity levels. Discussed nutritional support options, including a balanced diet with additional caloric supplements. Plan to start ONS TID in-between meals. RD following with Hepatology Team.
