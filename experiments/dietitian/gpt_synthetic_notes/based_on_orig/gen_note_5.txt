Nutrition Assessment

JH is a 12-year-old female who presented to the ED with complaints of extreme fatigue, polyuria, polydipsia, and significant weight loss over the past two months. Admitted to the Endocrinology floor for further evaluation and management. Lab results confirmed diagnosis of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus with an HbA1c of 12.3%. Now s/p initial insulin therapy initiation (6/12) with Dr. T. Pt was NPO initially with IV fluids, diet advanced on POD 2. Plan for long-term diabetes management and nutritional support. RD now consulted due to poor PO intake and significant weight loss. Met with family at bedside; parents report that at baseline, JH is a healthy eater, but her appetite has significantly decreased since symptoms worsened. Reports daily intake of <50% of usual intake. Parents estimate JH has lost approximately 5 kg since a pediatrician visit two months ago (15% weight loss). Per growth chart review, noted pt has lost ~4.8 kg since a PCP appointment 2 months ago (15% weight loss). Pt noted to have a very thin appearance with moderate muscle wasting. Parents report that since diagnosis, JH has been more lethargic and less active. Discussed nutritional support options, including carbohydrate counting and insulin management. Plan to start ONS TID in-between meals. RD following with Endocrinology Team.
