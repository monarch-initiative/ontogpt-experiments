Nutrition Assessment

ER is a 5-year-old female who presented to the ED with complaints of chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, and poor weight gain over the past three months. Admitted to the Gastroenterology floor for further evaluation and management. Lab results and endoscopy confirmed diagnosis of Crohn’s disease. Now s/p endoscopic biopsy (6/12) with Dr. M. Pt was NPO initially with IV fluids, diet advanced on POD 1. Plan for long-term gastrointestinal management and nutritional support. RD now consulted due to poor PO intake and significant weight loss. Met with family at bedside; parents report that at baseline, ER is a picky eater, and her appetite has significantly decreased since symptoms worsened. Reports daily intake of <30% of usual intake. Parents estimate ER has lost approximately 1.5 kg since a pediatrician visit two months ago (10% weight loss). Per growth chart review, noted pt has lost ~1.4 kg since a PCP appointment 2 months ago (10% weight loss). Pt noted to have a very thin appearance with mild muscle wasting. Parents report that since diagnosis, ER has been more lethargic and has had decreased activity levels. Discussed nutritional support options, including elemental formulas. Plan to start ONS TID in-between meals. RD following with Gastroenterology Team.
