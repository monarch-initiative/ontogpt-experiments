I currently do not have direct access to the EMA (Edinburgh Mouse Atlas) Project's Emapa Ontology database or any real-time ontology lookup system. However, Emapa identifiers for specific anatomical terms can be found by using the official ontology lookup tools such as the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) database or OBO Foundry resources to find the most up-to-date identifiers. 

For your specific request, I would need to manually search each term in the Emapa database to provide you with the correct identifiers, which is beyond the capabilities of my current environment. If you require the Emapa identifiers for the given terms, I suggest visiting the MGI website (http://www.informatics.jax.org/) or a resource like OBO Foundry (http://www.obofoundry.org/) where you can use the ontology search tools provided.

To retrieve the identifiers for the anatomy terms you have listed, you would typically input each term into the search query of these resources to find the corresponding identifiers and annotations within the Emapa Ontology. If you have access to such tools, the process involves entering the term into the search field and then reviewing the search results for the exact anatomical term to locate the corresponding identifier (EMAPA ID).
