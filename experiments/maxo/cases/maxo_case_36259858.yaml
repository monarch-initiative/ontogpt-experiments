  Routine laboratory investigations showed hyperglycemia, low hemoglobin of
  11.1g/dl, and raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 33mm/hr. Liver, renal,
  and thyroid function tests were within normal limits. Echocardiography
  revealed normal biventricular systolic function with impaired relaxation of
  the left ventricle. Further investigations confirmed the presence of cystitis
  and gall stones. Radiographic examination of hands and feet confirmed the
  resorption of distal phalanges (acroosteolysis) and soft tissue calcific
  deposits close to the tips of fingers and toes with peri-articular
  osteoporosis (Figure 4). Decreased joint space at metacarpophalangeal joints
  was also noted. Cataracts were ruled out on slit-lamp examination and
  indirect laryngoscopic findings were also insignificant.
