# MaXO extraction test cases: from manual annotations

In this set of test cases, all grounded entities and relations are those defined within the set of MaXO annotations (see <https://github.com/monarch-initiative/maxo-annotations/blob/master/annotations/maxo-annotations.tsv>).

Only the identifiers and relations specified within the available annotations are included for each test case.

For example, if the following is the only annotation available for a test case:

```text
disease_id disease_name citation maxo_id maxo_label hpo_id maxo_relation evidence_code extension_id extension_label attribute creator last_update created_on
...
MONDO:0009367 Mckusick-kaufman Syndrome PMID:20301675 MAXO:0000004 surgical procedure HP:0030010 TREATS TAS    ORCID:0000-0001-5208-3432 2023-01-31 2022-02-10
```

then the test case should include only the following:

* For `input_text`, approximately one paragraph containing the disease, action, and phenotype entities specified in the annotation. These may not be perfect lexical matches to any ontology term's label. The paragraph should include the title of the document.
  * The text may be assembled from multiple non-consecutive selections of the source document. 
* For each of the `named_entities`, the CURIE specified in the annotation and the text within `input_text` corresponding to that identifier.
  * If the text from the source document does not explicitly mention the entitiy, use the corresponding ontology's label (this may be found on OLS - see <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/>).
* Add a relation under `extracted_object` for each annotation. In this case, the relation will be:

  ```yaml
  extracted_object:
    action_to_symptom:
      - subject: MAXO:0000004
        predicate: TREATS
        object:
          - HP:0030010
  ```
  
  If the same MaXO term corresponds to multiple objects (e.g., MAXO:0000448 -> HP:0011781 and MAXO:0000448 -> HP:0002897 are both existing annotations), provide the objects in a list as follows:

  ```yaml
    extracted_object:
    action_to_symptom:
      - subject: MAXO:0000448
        predicate: TREATS
        object:
          - HP:0011781
          - HP:0002897
  ```
