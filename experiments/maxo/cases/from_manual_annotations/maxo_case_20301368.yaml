  "Saethre-Chotzen Syndrome
  Management: Treatment of manifestations: Ongoing management by an established
  craniofacial team which may include cranioplasty in the first year of life
  and midface surgery in childhood as needed for dental malocclusion,
  swallowing difficulties, and respiratory problems. If a cleft palate is
  present, surgical repair usually follows cranioplasty. As needed: orthodontic
  treatment and/or orthognathic surgery at the completion of facial growth;
  developmental intervention; routine treatment of hearing loss; ophthalmologic
  evaluation and, if ptosis is present, intervention to prevent amblyopia, with
  surgical repair during early childhood as needed."
