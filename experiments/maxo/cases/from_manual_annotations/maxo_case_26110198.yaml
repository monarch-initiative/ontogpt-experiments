  "Prolidase Deficiency
  Treatment of manifestations: Skin ulcers may require treatment by a wound
  care specialist; topical proline (often 5%) or topical 5% proline-5% glycine
  ointment applied with dressing changes has been successful in some affected
  individuals. Standard treatment for developmental delay / intellectual
  disability, seizures, infections, reactive airways disease / pulmonary
  hypertension, SLE-like features, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, mast
  cell activation, osteopenia, dental anomalies, and refractive errors. Anemia
  and thrombocytopenia rarely require treatment, but packed red blood cell or
  platelet transfusions may be considered in those with severe anemia or
  thrombocytopenia, respectively."
