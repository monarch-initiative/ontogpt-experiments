  "Myhre Syndrome
  The diagnosis of Myhre syndrome is established in a proband
  with characteristic clinical findings and a heterozygous
  pathogenic (or likely pathogenic) variant in SMAD4 detected
  by molecular genetic testing. Management. Treatment of
  manifestations: Feeding therapy with a low threshold for a
  clinical and/or radiographic swallowing study; referral to
  nutrition for poor weight gain or obesity; medical therapy
  for systemic and/or pulmonary hypertension; long-term
  tracheostomy may be required for those with complete or
  recurrent tracheal stenosis; aggressive medical management
  for constipation; physical therapy to keep joints mobile;
  hearing aids may be helpful for those with hearing loss;
  some keloids can be treated with intralesional steroids
  with minimal invasiveness for lesion removal; and standard
  treatment for orofacial clefting / velopharyngeal
  insufficiency, congenital heart defects / pericardial disease,
  restrictive lung disease, gastrointestinal stenosis,
  developmental delay / intellectual disability, refractive
  errors / strabismus / cataracts, persistent middle ear
  effusions, immunodeficiency, diabetes mellitus, and
  pubertal/menstrual irregularities.
  Orofacial clefting /Velopharyngeal insufficiency
  Standard treatment, ideally by craniofacial team
  Multidisciplinary teams may incl surgical team (craniofacial
  surgeon), clinical geneticist, otolaryngologist, pediatrician,
  radiologist, psychologist, multiple dental specialists,
  audiologist, speech therapist, & social worker.
  Restrictive lung disease 	Symptomatic & standard treatment
  per pulmonologist	Oxygen supplementation as necessary"
