  "Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 20
  Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis
  To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with
  spinocerebellar ataxia type 20 (SCA20), the evaluations summarized in this
  section (if not performed as part of the evaluation that led to the diagnosis)
  are recommended:
  Careful clinical and neurologic evaluation
  Speech assessment
  Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
  Treatment of Manifestations
  Affected persons should be followed by a neurologist with consultation from
  physiatrists and physical and occupational therapists.
  Although neither exercise nor physical therapy has been shown to stem the
  progression of incoordination or muscle weakness, individuals should maintain
  activity. Canes and walkers help prevent falls. Modification of the home with
  such conveniences as grab bars, raised toilet seats, and ramps to accommodate
  motorized chairs may be necessary. Speech therapy and communication devices
  such as writing pads and computer-based devices may benefit those with
  dysarthria or dysphonia. Weighted eating utensils and dressing hooks help
  maintain a sense of independence. Weight control is important because obesity
  can exacerbate difficulties with ambulation and mobility. When dysphagia
  becomes troublesome, videofluoroscopic swallow evaluation can identify the
  consistency of food least likely to trigger aspiration."
