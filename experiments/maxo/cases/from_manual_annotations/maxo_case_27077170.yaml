  "Adams-Oliver Syndrome â€“ RETIRED CHAPTER, FOR HISTORICAL
  REFERENCE ONLY
  Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS) is characterized by aplasia cutis
  congenita (ACC) of the scalp and terminal transverse limb
  defects (TTLD).
  Management. Treatment of manifestations: ACC. Care by a
  pediatric dermatologist and/or plastic surgeon depending on
  severity. Goals of non-operative therapy are to prevent infection
  and promote healing. Large and/or deep lesions with calvarial
  involvement require acute care and may eventually also require
  reconstruction by a neurosurgeon."
