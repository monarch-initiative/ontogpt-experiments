Corneal dystrophies are a group of non-inflammatory inherited disorders of the cornea. This review considers treatment options for epithelial-stromal 
and stromal corneal dystrophies namely Reis-Bücklers, Thiel-Behnke, lattice, Avellino, granular, macular and Schnyder corneal dystrophies. 
Where there is visual reduction, treatment options may include either phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) or corneal transplantation. 
Due to the anterior location of the deposits in Reis-Bücklers and Thiel-Behnke dystrophies, PTK is considered the treatment of choice. 
For lattice, Avellino, granular and macular corneal dystrophies, PTK provides temporary visual improvement; however, with recurrences, 
repeat PTK or a corneal transplant would be needed. For Schnyder dystrophy, should treatment be required, PTK may be the preferred option 
due to the potential for recurrence of the disease in corneal transplantation. This review discusses the literature and evidence base for 
the treatment of corneal dystrophies in terms of visual outcomes and recurrence rate.
