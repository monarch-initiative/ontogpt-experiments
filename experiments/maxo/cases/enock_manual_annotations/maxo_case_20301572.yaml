"
Bloom syndrome (BSyn) is characterized by severe pre- and postnatal growth deficiency, immune abnormalities, sensitivity to sunlight, 
insulin resistance, and a high risk for many cancers that occur at an early age. 

Agents/circumstances to avoid: Sun exposure to the face and other exposed skin, particularly in infancy and early childhood,
should be avoided. Exposure to ionizing radiation should be minimized. Dose reductions and shortened courses of chemotherapy 
when needed to avoid significant side effects and toxicity (including secondary malignancies). Alkylating agents and radiation 
therapy are considered high risk and are avoided when possible in those with BSyn.
