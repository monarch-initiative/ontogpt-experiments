To overcome these challenges, a novel Blind Start design was utilized in a study of vestronidase alfa
 in mucopolysaccharidosis VII (Sly syndrome), an ultra-rare lysosomal disease, that demonstrates the strengths of 
 this approach in a challenging drug-development setting. Twelve subjects were randomized to 1 of 4 blinded groups, 
 each crossing over to active treatment in a blinded fashion at different timepoints with efficacy analysis comparing 
 the last assessment before cross over to after 24 weeks of treatment. Study assessments included Percentage change from baseline 
 in urinary GAG (uGAG); a Multi-Domain Responder Index (MDRI) using prespecified minimal important differences (6-Minute Walk Test, 
 Forced Vital Capacity, shoulder flexion, visual acuity, and Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency); fatigue as assessed by 
 the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory™ Multidimensional Fatigue Scale; and safety.

We report a novel approach used in development of vestronidase alfa (recombinant human β-glucuronidase or rhGUS),
 an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for MPS VII, that included a unique Phase 3 Blind Start study design with a 
 variable placebo run-in period masking the start of vestronidase alfa, and allowing all subjects to be assessed for efficacy. 
 Another unique feature was the use of a Multi-Domain Responder Index (MDRI) that allowed translation of multiple clinical measures 
 into a combination responder endpoint assessed using minimally important difference (MID) thresholds without penalizing for 
 non-assessable endpoints in a heterogeneous patient population.
