Von Willebrand disease (VWD), a congenital bleeding disorder caused by deficient or defective plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF), 
may only become apparent on hemostatic challenge, and bleeding history may become more apparent with increasing age.  
 Affected individuals benefit from care in a comprehensive bleeding disorders program. 
 The two main treatments are desmopressin (1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin [DDAVP]) 
 and clotting factor concentrates (recombinant and plasma-derived) containing both VWF 
 and FVIII (VWF/FVIII concentrate). Indirect hemostatic treatments that can reduce symptoms 
 include fibrinolytic inhibitors; hormones for menorrhagia are also beneficial. 
 Individuals with VWD should receive prompt treatment for severe bleeding episodes. 
 Pregnant women with VWD are at increased risk for bleeding complications at or following childbirth.
