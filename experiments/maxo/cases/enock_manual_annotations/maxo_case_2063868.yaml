delta-Aminolevulinate dehydratase deficient porphyria, a recently recognized inborn error of heme biosynthesis, 
results from the markedly deficient activity of the heme biosynthetic enzyme, delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase (ALA-D). 
The four homozygotes described to date with this disorder have remarkably distinct phenotypes, ranging from a severely 
affected infant with failure to thrive to an essentially asymptomatic 68-year-old male. To investigate the molecular nature 
of the lesions causing the severe infantile-onset form, total RNA was isolated from cultured lymphoblasts of the affected homozygote, 
RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA, and the 990-bp ALA-D-coding region was amplified by the PCR. Heterozygosity for an RsaI RFLP within 
the ALA-dehydratase-coding region permitted identification of the paternal and maternal mutant alleles prior to sequencing. 

The maternal mutation (designated G133R), a G-to-A transition of nucleotide 397, predicted a glycine-to-arginine substitution at residue 
133 at the carboxyl end of the highly conserved zinc-binding site in the enzyme subunit.
