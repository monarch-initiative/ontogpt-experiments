APC-associated polyposis conditions include (classic or attenuated) familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and gastric adenocarcinoma 
and proximal polyposis of the stomach (GAPPS).

Resection of all colonic polyps larger than 5 mm found on colonic surveillance. There is an absolute indication for colectomy when 
CRC is diagnosed or suspected, or when there are significant symptoms (e.g., bleeding, obstruction). Relative indications for colectomy 
include presence of multiple adenomas larger than 10 mm that cannot be reasonably removed endoscopically, a significant increase in adenoma 
number between surveillance exams, presence of adenomas with high-grade dysplasia, or inability to adequately survey the colon (e.g., due to 
innumerable diminutive adenomas or limited access to or compliance with colonoscopy). Endoscopic or surgical removal of duodenal adenomas is 
considered if polyps exhibit villous change or severe dysplasia, exceed 1 cm in diameter, or exhibit advanced stage using Spigelman scoring system. 
Gastrectomy is considered if advanced gastric neoplasia is found on upper endoscopy. Osteomas may be removed for cosmetic reasons. 
Desmoid tumors may be surgically excised or treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), anti-estrogens, 
cytotoxic chemotherapy, and/or radiation if at advanced stage. Standard treatment when needed for adrenal masses and thyroid carcinoma. 
Several studies have shown that NSAIDs and erlotinib have caused regression of adenomas and decreased the polyp burden in individuals with FAP, 
though there are currently no FDA-approved chemopreventive agents for FAP, given an unclear effect on subsequent cancer risk.
