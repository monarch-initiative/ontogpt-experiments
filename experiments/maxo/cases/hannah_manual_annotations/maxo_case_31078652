  "2019 HRS expert consensus statement on evaluation, risk stratification, and management
  of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy
  IIb). Symptomatic arrhythmias? Yes Amiodarone (LOE B-NR) and sotalol (LOE C-LD) may be
  reasonable in individuals with ACM for control of arrhythmic symptoms or to reduce ICD
  shocks (COR IIb). Continued symptoms due to ventricular arrhythmias? Yes Preserved RV
  and LV function? Yes Flecainide in combination with beta-blockers and in the absence of
  other antiarrhythmic drugs may be reasonable in individuals with ACM, an ICD, and
  preserved LV and RV function for control of ventricular arrhythmias that are refractory
  to other therapies (COR IIb, LOE C-LD).
  Clinicians have long recognized that patients with ARVC were disproportionately athletes
  and that athletic patients with ARVC have a high risk of SCD. A seminal review of
  autopsies in Italy showed that participation in competitive athletics resulted in a
  more than 5-fold increase in SCD risk among adolescents and young adults with ARVC and
  that implementing a preparticipation screening program resulted in a sharp decline in
  deaths.
  Individuals with ARVC should not participate in competitive or frequent high-intensity endurance
  exercise as this is associated with increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and promoting
  progression of structural disease (COR III: Harm, LOE B-NR). Clinicians should counsel adolescent
  and adult individuals with a positive genetic test for ARVC but who are phenotype-negative that
  competitive or frequent high-intensity endurance exercise is associated with increased likelihood
  of developing ARVC and ventricular arrhythmias (COR I, LOE B-NR). Figure 16 Exercise recommendations
  for individuals with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). COR 5 Class of
  Recommendation; LOE 5 Level of Evidence. Colors correspond to COR in Figure 1."

# Note spelling of antiarrythmic in the MAxO term label "antiarrythmic agent therapy": this
# spelling does not appear in the cited reference. PMID 31078652 spells words derived from
# arrhythmia with an h after the double r. "antiarrhythmic agent therapy" is listed in maxo.obo
# as a synonym of "antiarrythmic agent therapy"

# The disease mentioned in the MAxO annotations is
# MONDO:0011831, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia 8 [Any arrhythmogenic right
# ventricular cardiomyopathy in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the DSP gene.]
# this is a child of
# MONDO:0016342 familial isolated arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia
# which is a child of
# MONDO:0016587 arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy
# PMID 31078652 mostly speaks of ARVC (MONDO:0016587). The DSP gene is listed along with
# several other genes in which pathogenic variants cause cardiomyopathy. Not sure why the
# annotations are specific to MONDO:0011831 when they seem to apply to all MONDO:0016587.
